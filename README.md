# Hacker News Live

This is an experimental project to see if I could bring live updates to the front page of Hacker News. The idea is that since Hacker News is a living, breathing community, you should be able to see life and motion as you view the frontpage.

Portions of code have been modified from publicly available styles from [Hacker News](1).
